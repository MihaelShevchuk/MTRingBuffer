/*!
 Provides a ring-buffer (or circular-buffer) that can be written to and read from
 asynchronously (blocking) or synchronously (non-blocking).
 
 The RingBuffer is an array of \b NumSlots slots of memory
 each of which is of size \b SlotSize bytes (8-bits). Slots can be read and
 written asynchronously/synchronously by multiple threads.
